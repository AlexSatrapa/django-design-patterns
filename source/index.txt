This is a collection of patterns which we have found occuring commonly with
Django. All of these either make collaboration easier, coding simpler or code
more maintainable. None of them are design patterns in the sense of GoF design
patterns. We call them design patterns as none other seem closer or more
convinient.

These are guidelines, which need to be overriden (very commonly, in some cases).
Use your judgement when using them. As PEP8 says, "Foolish consistency is the
hobgoblin of small minds."
