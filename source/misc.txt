settings.py and localsettings.py
------------------------------------
The settings for your project which are a machine specific should be refactored
out of settings.py into localsettings.py. In your settings.py, you should do

try:
    from localsettings import *
except ImportError:
    print 'localsetting could not be imported'
    pass #Or raise
    
This should be at the end of settings.py, so that localsetting.py override
settings in settings.py

This file should not be checked in your repository.
