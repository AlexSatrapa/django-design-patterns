settings.py and localsettings.py
------------------------------------
The settings for your project which are a machine specific should be refactored
out of settings.py into localsettings.py. In your settings.py, you should do

try:
    from localsettings import *
except ImportError:
    print 'localsetting could not be imported'
    pass #Or raise
    
This should be at the end of settings.py, so that localsetting.py override
settings in settings.py

This file should not be checked in your repository.

Use templatetags when the output doesnot depend on the Request
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In your sidebar suppose you want to show the 5 latest comments. You do not need
the request to output this. Make it as a templatetag.

Import as if your apps are on your project path
----------------------------------------------------
Instead of doing `from project.app.models import ModelClass` do `from app.models
import ModelClass`. Your apps are reusable
