Do not commit the generated files
-----------------------------------
Django does not have a lot of auto generated files. However as you work with
other django apps, you may come across auto generated files. These should not be
checked in the the Django repository.
For example, for this book, we checkin the source files and folder, but not the
autogenerated build folders.
